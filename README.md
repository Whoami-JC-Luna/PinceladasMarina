Clonar el reposotiorio del theme: 

**Make sure you've ruby, bundler and jekyll in your local machine

Clone the repository form https://github.com/StaticMania/roxo-jekyll

Install dependency using command bundle install --> Check the installed versions and adjust the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to resolve issues with the gems versions.

Serve locally by using bundler exec jekyll serve command -->   In my case, I had to manually install gems that werenâ€™t being installed with the current versions when running bundle install due to version conflicts. For example, the rexml gem required by kramdown and the webrick gem. Afterward, I added the webrick gem to the Gemfile and ran bundle install again, which increased the number of installed gems. From there, I proceeded by executing bundler exec jekyll serve, and everything worked as expected. 

Build your site by using command jekyll build.
